# Study Abroad Language App: Document Your Language Learning Abroad App

#### Java project for Epicodus, August 2017

#### By Kate Byars

## Description
This App is for the student traveling abroad. Although electronic translators and dictionaries serve a purpose in more traditional settings, the act of learning a language on the go is a different experience. Students can track the words that they have learned, alongside the locations they have visited. The Study Abroad Language App helps you associate what you learned with where you learned it, so you can always access it via your own memory reference points. For example: Can't remember the name of the dish you ate at a new Italian friend's house in Florence, and all the kitchen words her mom taught you? Go to your Study Abroad Language App, where you recorded these words under "Gina's House"; or, access them via a single word, phrase, or alphabetical list.
